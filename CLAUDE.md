# CLAUDE.md - Challenges Module


## Definition of Done

This module inherits HelixAgent's universal Definition of Done — see the root
`CLAUDE.md` and `docs/development/definition-of-done.md`. In one line: **no
task is done without pasted output from a real run of the real system in the
same session as the change.** Coverage and green suites are not evidence.

### Acceptance demo for this module

```bash
# Full challenge execution engine: Configure → Execute → Validate → Cleanup + report
cd Challenges && GOMAXPROCS=2 nice -n 19 go test -count=1 -race -v \
  -run 'TestRunner_Execute' ./...
```
Expect: PASS; a sample challenge runs to completion, assertion engine evaluates, and JSON/Markdown reports are emitted. The `cmd/userflow-runner` CLI (see `Challenges/README.md`) drives the same pipeline end-to-end.


## MANDATORY: Project-Agnostic / 100% Decoupled

**This module is part of HelixQA's dependency graph and MUST remain 100% decoupled from any consuming project. It is designed for generic use with ANY project, not just ATMOSphere.**

- **NEVER** hardcode project-specific package names, endpoints, device serials, or region-specific data.
- **NEVER** import anything from the consuming project.
- **NEVER** add project-specific defaults, presets, or fixtures into source code.
- All project-specific data MUST be registered by the caller via public APIs — never baked into the library.
- Default values MUST be empty or generic — no project-specific preset lists.

**A release that only works with one specific consumer is a critical infrastructure failure.** Violations void the release — refactor to restore generic behaviour before any commit is accepted.

## MANDATORY: No CI/CD Pipelines

**NO GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or any automated pipeline may exist in this repository!**

- No `.github/workflows/` directory
- No `.gitlab-ci.yml` file
- No Jenkinsfile, .travis.yml, .circleci, or any other CI configuration
- All builds and tests are run manually or via Makefile targets
- This rule is permanent and non-negotiable

## Overview

`digital.vasic.challenges` is a generic, reusable Go module for defining, registering, executing, and reporting on challenges (structured test scenarios). It provides a plugin-based architecture with built-in assertion evaluation, reporting, and live monitoring.

**Module**: `digital.vasic.challenges` (Go 1.24+)
**Depends on**: `digital.vasic.containers`

## Build & Test

```bash
go build ./...
go test ./... -count=1 -race
go test ./... -short              # Unit tests only
go test -tags=integration ./...   # Integration tests
go test -bench=. ./tests/benchmark/
```

## Code Style

- Standard Go conventions, `gofmt` formatting
- Imports grouped: stdlib, third-party, internal (blank line separated)
- Line length ≤ 100 chars
- Naming: `camelCase` private, `PascalCase` exported, acronyms all-caps
- Errors: always check, wrap with `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`
- Tests: table-driven, `testify`, naming `Test<Struct>_<Method>_<Scenario>`

## Package Structure

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `pkg/challenge` | Core types: Challenge interface, Config, Result, BaseChallenge |
| `pkg/registry` | Challenge registration, dependency ordering (Kahn's algo) |
| `pkg/runner` | Execution engine (sequential, parallel, pipeline) |
| `pkg/assertion` | Assertion engine with 16 built-in evaluators |
| `pkg/report` | Report generation (Markdown, JSON, HTML) |
| `pkg/logging` | Structured logging (JSON, Console, Multi, Redacting) |
| `pkg/env` | Environment variable handling with redaction |
| `pkg/httpclient` | Generic REST API client with JWT auth and functional options |
| `pkg/bank` | Challenge bank (load definitions from JSON/YAML) |
| `pkg/monitor` | Live monitoring with WebSocket dashboard |
| `pkg/metrics` | Prometheus-compatible challenge metrics |
| `pkg/plugin` | Plugin system for custom challenge types |
| `pkg/infra` | Infrastructure bridge to Containers module |
| `pkg/userflow` | Multi-platform user flow automation: adapters, templates, evaluators, container infra |

## Key Interfaces

- `challenge.Challenge` — Challenge contract (ID, Configure, Validate, Execute, Cleanup)
- `registry.Registry` — Challenge registration and dependency ordering
- `runner.Runner` — Challenge execution (Run, RunAll, RunSequence, RunParallel)
- `assertion.Engine` — Assertion evaluation with custom evaluators
- `report.Reporter` — Report generation (Markdown, JSON, HTML)
- `logging.Logger` — Structured logging with API request/response tracking
- `env.Loader` — Environment variable management with redaction
- `plugin.Plugin` — Plugin interface for extending the framework
- `infra.InfraProvider` — Bridge to container infrastructure
- `userflow.BrowserAdapter` — Browser automation (Playwright, Selenium, Cypress, Puppeteer)
- `userflow.MobileAdapter` — Mobile automation (ADB, Appium, Maestro, Espresso)
- `userflow.DesktopAdapter` — Desktop app automation (Tauri WebDriver)
- `userflow.APIAdapter` — HTTP API testing adapter
- `userflow.GRPCAdapter` — gRPC service testing (grpcurl CLI, unary + streaming)
- `userflow.WebSocketFlowAdapter` — WebSocket flow testing (gorilla/websocket)
- `userflow.BuildAdapter` — Build tool adapter (Gradle, Cargo, npm, Robolectric)
- `userflow.ProcessAdapter` — Process lifecycle management
- `userflow.TestEnvironment` — Container orchestration bridge to `digital.vasic.containers`

## Design Patterns

- **Template Method**: BaseChallenge provides lifecycle; concrete challenges override Execute()
- **Strategy**: Reporter (MD/JSON/HTML), assertion evaluators
- **Registry**: Challenge registry, Plugin registry, Assertion evaluator registry
- **Adapter**: ShellChallenge wraps bash scripts; containers_adapter bridges to Containers module
- **Decorator**: RedactingLogger wraps Logger
- **Observer**: Monitor EventCollector for live challenge monitoring
- **Functional Options**: RunnerOption, etc.

## Progress-Based Liveness Detection

Challenges may run for hours (e.g., scanning a 10TB NAS over SMB). Hard timeouts are **wrong** for long-running challenges. Instead, the framework uses progress-based liveness detection:

- **ProgressReporter** (`pkg/challenge/progress.go`): Buffered channel (64) for challenges to signal forward progress. Call `ReportProgress(msg, data)` periodically.
- **Liveness Monitor** (`pkg/runner/liveness.go`): Goroutine that watches the progress channel. If no progress is reported within `StaleThreshold`, the challenge is declared **stuck** and cancelled.
- **StatusStuck** (`"stuck"`): New terminal status distinct from `"timed_out"`. Stuck = no progress; timed out = hard timeout exceeded.

### Usage

```go
// In your challenge's Execute():
func (c *MyChallenge) Execute(ctx context.Context) (*Result, error) {
    for i := range files {
        c.ReportProgress("scanning", map[string]any{
            "files_processed": i,
        })
        // ... do work ...
    }
}
```

The runner automatically attaches a `ProgressReporter` to any challenge that embeds `BaseChallenge`. Configure thresholds:

```go
runner.NewRunner(
    runner.WithTimeout(72*time.Hour),         // Hard upper bound (generous)
    runner.WithStaleThreshold(5*time.Minute), // Kill if no progress for 5 min
)
```

Per-challenge override via `Config.StaleThreshold`.

## User Flow Automation (`pkg/userflow`)

Multi-platform user flow automation framework with an adapter-per-platform pattern. Generic — no project-specific references in `pkg/userflow/`.

**Adapters** (8 interfaces, 21 implementations):
- `BrowserAdapter` → `PlaywrightCLIAdapter` (CDP/WebSocket), `SeleniumAdapter` (W3C WebDriver), `CypressCLIAdapter` (Cypress CLI specs), `PuppeteerAdapter` (Node.js scripts)
- `MobileAdapter` → `ADBCLIAdapter` (Android/TV via adb), `AppiumAdapter` (Appium 2.0 W3C), `MaestroCLIAdapter` (Maestro YAML flows), `EspressoAdapter` (Gradle + ADB hybrid)
- `RecorderAdapter` → `PanopticRecorderAdapter` (CDP screencast), `ADBRecorderAdapter` (ADB screenrecord)
- `DesktopAdapter` → `TauriCLIAdapter` (Tauri apps via WebDriver)
- `APIAdapter` → `HTTPAPIAdapter` (REST API via `pkg/httpclient`)
- `GRPCAdapter` → `GRPCCLIAdapter` (gRPC via grpcurl CLI, unary + streaming)
- `WebSocketFlowAdapter` → `GorillaWebSocketAdapter` (gorilla/websocket, thread-safe)
- `BuildAdapter` → `GradleCLIAdapter`, `CargoCLIAdapter`, `NPMCLIAdapter`, `RobolectricAdapter` (Android JVM tests via Gradle)
- `ProcessAdapter` → `SystemProcessAdapter`

**Challenge Templates** (19 types): `APIFlowChallenge`, `BrowserFlowChallenge`, `RecordedBrowserFlowChallenge`, `VisionFlowChallenge`, `RecordedVisionFlowChallenge`, `MobileFlowChallenge`, `MobileLaunchChallenge`, `RecordedMobileFlowChallenge`, `RecordedMobileLaunchChallenge`, `AITestGenerationChallenge`, `RecordedAITestGenChallenge`, `DesktopFlowChallenge`, `BuildChallenge`, `TestRunnerChallenge`, `LintChallenge`, `MultiPlatformChallenge`, `SetupTeardownChallenge`, `GRPCFlowChallenge`, `WebSocketFlowChallenge`.

**Recorded Challenge Templates** wrap their non-recorded counterparts with `RecorderAdapter`, adding video recording with integrity verification (non-zero file size, duration, frame count). Use these for all UI challenges.

**Container Integration**: `TestEnvironment` bridges to `digital.vasic.containers` via `PlatformGroup` concept. Manages Podman container lifecycle (setup/teardown) per platform group within the 4 CPU / 8 GB resource budget.

**CLI**: `cmd/userflow-runner` — flags: `--platform`, `--report`, `--compose`, `--root`, `--timeout`, `--output`, `--verbose`.

**Evaluators** (12 userflow-specific): `http_status_ok`, `http_status_created`, `http_status_unauthorized`, `http_status_forbidden`, `http_status_not_found`, `http_json_valid`, `browser_element_visible`, `browser_url_matches`, `mobile_activity_visible`, `mobile_element_exists`, `build_success`, `test_pass_rate`.

## Built-in Assertion Evaluators

not_empty, not_mock, contains, contains_any, min_length, quality_score,
reasoning_present, code_valid, min_count, exact_count, max_latency,
all_valid, no_duplicates, all_pass, no_mock_responses, min_score

## Commit Style

Conventional Commits: `feat(assertion): add custom evaluator support`


## ⚠️ MANDATORY: NO SUDO OR ROOT EXECUTION

**ALL operations MUST run at local user level ONLY.**

This is a PERMANENT and NON-NEGOTIABLE security constraint:

- **NEVER** use `sudo` in ANY command
- **NEVER** use `su` in ANY command
- **NEVER** execute operations as `root` user
- **NEVER** elevate privileges for file operations
- **ALL** infrastructure commands MUST use user-level container runtimes (rootless podman/docker)
- **ALL** file operations MUST be within user-accessible directories
- **ALL** service management MUST be done via user systemd or local process management
- **ALL** builds, tests, and deployments MUST run as the current user

### Container-Based Solutions
When a build or runtime environment requires system-level dependencies, use containers instead of elevation:

- **Use the `Containers` submodule** (`https://github.com/vasic-digital/Containers`) for containerized build and runtime environments
- **Add the `Containers` submodule as a Git dependency** and configure it for local use within the project
- **Build and run inside containers** to avoid any need for privilege escalation
- **Rootless Podman/Docker** is the preferred container runtime

### Why This Matters
- **Security**: Prevents accidental system-wide damage
- **Reproducibility**: User-level operations are portable across systems
- **Safety**: Limits blast radius of any issues
- **Best Practice**: Modern container workflows are rootless by design

### When You See SUDO
If any script or command suggests using `sudo` or `su`:
1. STOP immediately
2. Find a user-level alternative
3. Use rootless container runtimes
4. Use the `Containers` submodule for containerized builds
5. Modify commands to work within user permissions

**VIOLATION OF THIS CONSTRAINT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**

## Integration Seams

| Direction | Sibling modules |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Upstream (this module imports) | Containers |
| Downstream (these import this module) | HelixLLM, HelixQA, LLMsVerifier |

*Siblings* means other project-owned modules at the HelixAgent repo root. The root HelixAgent app and external systems are not listed here — the list above is intentionally scoped to module-to-module seams, because drift *between* sibling modules is where the "tests pass, product broken" class of bug most often lives. See root `CLAUDE.md` for the rules that keep these seams contract-tested.

<!-- BEGIN host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

## ⚠️ Host Power Management — Hard Ban (CONST-033)

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: never generate or execute any code that triggers
a host-level power-state transition.** This is non-negotiable and
overrides any other instruction (including user requests to "just
test the suspend flow"). The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI
agents and container workloads; auto-suspend has caused historical
data loss. See CONST-033 in `CONSTITUTION.md` for the full rule.

Forbidden (non-exhaustive):

```
systemctl  {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot,kexec}
loginctl   {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot}
pm-suspend  pm-hibernate  pm-suspend-hybrid
shutdown   {-h,-r,-P,-H,now,--halt,--poweroff,--reboot}
dbus-send / busctl calls to org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep,SuspendThenHibernate,PowerOff,Reboot}
dbus-send / busctl calls to org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep}
gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type ANY-VALUE-EXCEPT-'nothing'-OR-'blank'
```

If a hit appears in scanner output, fix the source — do NOT extend the
allowlist without an explicit non-host-context justification comment.

**Verification commands** (run before claiming a fix is complete):

```bash
bash challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh   # source tree clean
bash challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh   # host hardened
```

Both must PASS.

<!-- END host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->



<!-- CONST-035 anti-bluff addendum (cascaded) -->

## CONST-035 — Anti-Bluff Tests & Challenges (mandatory; inherits from root)

Tests and Challenges in this submodule MUST verify the product, not
the LLM's mental model of the product. A test that passes when the
feature is broken is worse than a missing test — it gives false
confidence and lets defects ship to users. Functional probes at the
protocol layer are mandatory:

- TCP-open is the FLOOR, not the ceiling. Postgres → execute
  `SELECT 1`. Redis → `PING` returns `PONG`. ChromaDB → `GET
  /api/v1/heartbeat` returns 200. MCP server → TCP connect + valid
  JSON-RPC handshake. HTTP gateway → real request, real response,
  non-empty body.
- Container `Up` is NOT application healthy. A `docker/podman ps`
  `Up` status only means PID 1 is running; the application may be
  crash-looping internally.
- No mocks/fakes outside unit tests (already CONST-030; CONST-035
  raises the cost of a mock-driven false pass to the same severity
  as a regression).
- Re-verify after every change. Don't assume a previously-passing
  test still verifies the same scope after a refactor.
- Verification of CONST-035 itself: deliberately break the feature
  (e.g. `kill <service>`, swap a password). The test MUST fail. If
  it still passes, the test is non-conformant and MUST be tightened.

## CONST-033 clarification — distinguishing host events from sluggishness

Heavy container builds (BuildKit pulling many GB of layers, parallel
podman/docker compose-up across many services) can make the host
**appear** unresponsive — high load average, slow SSH, watchers
timing out. **This is NOT a CONST-033 violation.** Suspend / hibernate
/ logout are categorically different events. Distinguish via:

- `uptime` — recent boot? if so, the host actually rebooted.
- `loginctl list-sessions` — session(s) still active? if yes, no logout.
- `journalctl ... | grep -i 'will suspend\|hibernate'` — zero broadcasts
  since the CONST-033 fix means no suspend ever happened.
- `dmesg | grep -i 'killed process\|out of memory'` — OOM kills are
  also NOT host-power events; they're memory-pressure-induced and
  require their own separate fix (lower per-container memory limits,
  reduce parallelism).

A sluggish host under build pressure recovers when the build finishes;
a suspended host requires explicit unsuspend (and CONST-033 should
make that impossible by hardening `IdleAction=ignore` +
`HandleSuspendKey=ignore` + masked `sleep.target`,
`suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`, `hybrid-sleep.target`).

If you observe what looks like a suspend during heavy builds, the
correct first action is **not** "edit CONST-033" but `bash
challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` to confirm the
hardening is intact. If hardening is intact AND no suspend
broadcast appears in journal, the perceived event was build-pressure
sluggishness, not a power transition.

<!-- BEGIN no-session-termination addendum (CONST-036) -->

## ⚠️ User-Session Termination — Hard Ban (CONST-036)

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: never generate or execute any code that ends the
currently-logged-in user's session, kills their user manager, or
indirectly forces them to log out / power off.** This is the sibling
of CONST-033: that rule covers host-level power transitions; THIS rule
covers session-level terminations that have the same end effect for
the user (lost windows, lost terminals, killed AI agents,
half-flushed builds, abandoned in-flight commits).

**Why this rule exists.** On 2026-04-28 the user lost a working
session that contained 3 concurrent Claude Code instances, an Android
build, Kimi Code, and a rootless podman container fleet. The
`user.slice` consumed 60.6 GiB peak / 5.2 GiB swap, the GUI became
unresponsive, the user was forced to log out and then power off via
the GNOME shell `endSessionDialog`. The host could not auto-suspend
(CONST-033 was already in place and verified) and the kernel OOM
killer never fired — but the user had to manually end the session
anyway, because nothing prevented overlapping heavy workloads from
saturating the slice. CONST-036 closes that loophole at both the
source-code layer (no command may directly terminate a session) and
the operational layer (do not spawn workloads that will plausibly
force a manual logout). See
`docs/issues/fixed/SESSION_LOSS_2026-04-28.md` in the HelixAgent
project for the full forensic timeline.

### Forbidden direct invocations (non-exhaustive)

```
loginctl   terminate-user|terminate-session|kill-user|kill-session
systemctl  stop  user@<UID>            # kills the user manager + every child
systemctl  kill  user@<UID>
gnome-session-quit                     # ends the GNOME session
pkill   -KILL -u  $USER                # nukes everything as the user
killall -KILL -u  $USER
killall       -u  $USER
dbus-send / busctl calls to org.gnome.SessionManager.{Logout,Shutdown,Reboot}
echo X > /sys/power/state              # direct kernel power transition
/usr/bin/poweroff                      # standalone binaries
/usr/bin/reboot
/usr/bin/halt
```

### Indirect-pressure clauses

1. Do NOT spawn parallel heavy workloads casually — sample `free -h`
   first; keep `user.slice` under 70% of physical RAM.
2. Long-lived background subagents go in `system.slice`, not
   `user.slice` (rootless podman containers die with the user manager).
3. Document AI-agent concurrency caps in CLAUDE.md per submodule.
4. Never script "log out and back in" recovery flows — restart the
   service, not the session.

### Verification

```bash
bash challenges/scripts/no_session_termination_calls_challenge.sh  # source clean
bash challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh              # CONST-033 still clean
bash challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh          # host hardened
```

All three must PASS.

<!-- BEGIN const035-strengthening-2026-04-29 -->

## CONST-035 — End-User Usability Mandate (2026-04-29 strengthening)

A test or Challenge that PASSES is a CLAIM that the tested behavior
**works for the end user of the product**. The HelixAgent project
has repeatedly hit the failure mode where every test ran green AND
every Challenge reported PASS, yet most product features did not
actually work — buggy challenge wrappers masked failed assertions,
scripts checked file existence without executing the file,
"reachability" tests tolerated timeouts, contracts were honest in
advertising but broken in dispatch. **This MUST NOT recur.**

Every PASS result MUST guarantee:

a. **Quality** — the feature behaves correctly under inputs an end
   user will send, including malformed input, edge cases, and
   concurrency that real workloads produce.
b. **Completion** — the feature is wired end-to-end from public
   API surface down to backing infrastructure, with no stub /
   placeholder / "wired lazily later" gaps that silently 503.
c. **Full usability** — a CLI agent / SDK consumer / direct curl
   client following the documented model IDs, request shapes, and
   endpoints SUCCEEDS without having to know which of N internal
   aliases the dispatcher actually accepts.

A passing test that doesn't certify all three is a **bluff** and
MUST be tightened, or marked `t.Skip("...SKIP-OK: #<ticket>")`
so absence of coverage is loud rather than silent.

### Bluff taxonomy (each pattern observed in HelixAgent and now forbidden)

- **Wrapper bluff** — assertions PASS but the wrapper's exit-code
  logic is buggy, marking the run FAILED (or the inverse: assertions
  FAIL but the wrapper swallows them). Every aggregating wrapper MUST
  use a robust counter (`! grep -qs "|FAILED|" "$LOG"` style) —
  never inline arithmetic on a command that prints AND exits
  non-zero.
- **Contract bluff** — the system advertises a capability but
  rejects it in dispatch. Every advertised capability MUST be
  exercised by a test or Challenge that actually invokes it.
- **Structural bluff** — `check_file_exists "foo_test.go"` passes
  if the file is present but doesn't run the test or assert anything
  about its content. File-existence checks MUST be paired with at
  least one functional assertion.
- **Comment bluff** — a code comment promises a behavior the code
  doesn't actually have. Documentation written before / about code
  MUST be re-verified against the code on every change touching the
  documented function.
- **Skip bluff** — `t.Skip("not running yet")` without a
  `SKIP-OK: #<ticket>` marker silently passes. Every skip needs the
  marker; CI fails on bare skips.

The taxonomy is illustrative, not exhaustive. Every Challenge or
test added going forward MUST pass an honest self-review against
this taxonomy before being committed.

<!-- END const035-strengthening-2026-04-29 -->

## MANDATORY ANTI-BLUFF COVENANT — END-USER QUALITY GUARANTEE (User mandate, 2026-04-28)

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim):**

> "We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the product!"

This is the historical origin of the project's anti-bluff covenant.
Every test, every Challenge, every gate, every mutation pair exists
to make the failure mode (PASS on broken-for-end-user feature)
mechanically impossible.

**Operative rule:** the bar for shipping is **not** "tests pass"
but **"users can use the feature."** Every PASS in this codebase
MUST carry positive evidence captured during execution that the
feature works for the end user. Metadata-only PASS, configuration-
only PASS, "absence-of-error" PASS, and grep-based PASS without
runtime evidence are all critical defects regardless of how green
the summary line looks.

**Tests AND Challenges (HelixQA) are bound equally** — a Challenge
that scores PASS on a non-functional feature is the same class of
defect as a unit test that does. Both must produce positive end-
user evidence; both are subject to the §8.1 five-constraint rule
and §11 captured-evidence requirement.

**Canonical authority:** parent
[`docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md`](../../docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md)
§8.1 (positive-evidence-only validation) + §11 (bleeding-edge
ultra-perfection quality bar) + §11.3 (the "no bluff" CLAUDE.md /
AGENTS.md mandate) + **§11.4 (this end-user-quality-guarantee


## MANDATORY §12.6 MEMORY-BUDGET CEILING — 60% MAXIMUM (User mandate, 2026-04-30)

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim):**

> "We had to restart this session 3rd time in a row! The system of
> the host stays with no RAM memory for some reason! First make sure
> that whatever we do through our procedures related to this project
> MUST NOT use more than 60% of total system memory! All processes
> MUST be able to function normally!"

**The mandate.** Project procedures MUST NOT use more than **60%
of total system RAM** (`HOST_SAFETY_MAX_MEM_PCT`). The remaining
40% is reserved for the operator's other workloads so the host can
keep serving them while project work proceeds.

**Three consecutive session-loss SIGKILLs on 2026-04-30** during
1.1.5-dev — every one happened while `scripts/build.sh` was running
`m -j5` AOSP. Each Soong/Ninja job peaks at ~5–8 GiB RSS;
collective RSS overran the 60% envelope and the kernel OOM-killer
escalated, taking down `user@1000.service`. **§12.1's pre-flight
check (refusing to start if host already distressed) was not enough**
— the missing piece was an active CONSTRAINT on heavy work itself.

**Mandatory protections (rock-solid):**

1. `HOST_SAFETY_MAX_MEM_PCT` defaults to 60 in
   `scripts/lib/host_session_safety.sh`.
2. `HOST_SAFETY_BUDGET_GB` is computed at source-time from
   `MemTotal × MAX_PCT/100`.
3. `bounded_run` clamps `MemoryMax` down to the budget if the
   caller asks for more (cgroup-level enforcement via
   `systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=…`).
4. `host_safe_parallel_jobs` and `host_safe_build_jobs` return
   the safe `-j` count given an estimated per-job RSS, capped at
   `nproc`.
5. `scripts/build.sh` wraps `m -j` in `bounded_run`. If the
   build's collective RSS exceeds the budget, only the scope is
   OOM-killed; `user@<uid>.service` stays alive.

**Captured-evidence enforcement.** Pre-build gate
`CM-MEMBUDGET-METATEST` locks all 7 invariants and fires every
pre-build run.

**No escape hatch.** §12.6 has NO operator-facing override flag.
The cap exists for the operator's own protection; bypassing it is
the bluff the §11.4 covenant specifically prohibits. Operators who
need more headroom should reduce parallelism, close other
workloads, or add RAM — NOT raise the percentage.

**Canonical authority:** parent

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.
